## Check Your Understanding Questions: 

1. I am choosing option 1. "Within a Github action that runs whenever code is pushed " because it is the best option of the three to ensure that code is adequately tested and safe to have in the main repo. If we decided to go with option 2. and included the automated tests as something manual that the developer has to do, there may be instances where the developer may forget to run these tests and we could have erroneous code pushed to the main repo. For option 3. it would be the most inefficient of the three due to the fact that there could have been erroneous code written with bugs all over and we wouldnt know until the code was pushed, deployed and tested on the actual website by users as opposed to a testing team. Option 1. ensures the most safety and a 100% chance of code being tested before being pushed.  
   
2. NO
